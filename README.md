# üöÄ Crypto Checkout Simulator (PHP, Laravel)

This project simulates a backend service (API) for a crypto-based event ticket checkout using Laravel. It mocks the behavior of Coinbase Commerce and demonstrates basic webhook integration.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lrencallado/crypto-checkout-simulator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd crypto-checkout-simulator
    ```
3. Install dependencies using Composer
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (if not existing):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
5. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:
    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```
6. Generate the application key (if `APP_KEY` from `.env` is null):
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
7. Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
8. Run on the dev environment
   Using composer
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

   Using Docker
   ```
   docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d
   ```

## Testing

1. Run the test:
    ```bash
    php artisan test --filter test_checkout_endpoint
    ```

## üìê Assumptions Made

### ‚úÖ Repository and Service Pattern

- **Why?** For better separation of concerns and cleaner code.
- **Advantages:**
  - Easier to test and maintain.
  - Isolates business logic from controllers.
  - Flexible for feature expansion.
  - The Repository Pattern acts as a bridge between the business logic and the data layer (usually a database). It centralizes data access logic, making the application easier to test, maintain, and extend.

### ‚úÖ Assuming this is an API
- Use Laravel default prefix for api routes to avoid naming conflicts with web routes `/api`.

### ‚úÖ API Versioning (`Api\V1`)

- Organizes controllers in a versioned folder structure (`Api/V1`) to prepare for future API iterations.
- Simplifies long-term maintenance and supports backward compatibility.

### ‚úÖ Laravel Sanctum for API Authentication

- Laravel Sanctum to authenticate API requests via token-based auth.
- Chosen for its simplicity and native Laravel integration
- Protects routes like `/api/v1/checkout`

### ‚úÖ Validated Requests

- Form Requests (`CheckoutRequest`) ensure clean, centralized input validation.
- Keeps controllers slim and focused.

### ‚úÖ Spatie Webhook-Client Package

- Uses the Spatie Webhook Client package to handle incoming webhook requests securely.
- Verifies signatures against a shared secret to ensure webhook authenticity.
- Offers a clean, extendable structure for processing different types of webhook payloads.

### ‚úÖ Simulated Coinbase API Integration

- Coinbase interactions are mocked, returning fake URLs and responses.
- Webhooks simulate a payment status change from Coinbase payload.

### ‚úÖ amount column uses BIGINT

- In real-world payment systems, it‚Äôs a best practice to store monetary values in the smallest currency unit
- This avoids floating-point rounding issues and ensures arithmetic precision.
- Most payment gateways operate using integer-based currency units to eliminate decimal inaccuracies.

## üõ† Potential Improvements

- Admin panel for manually retrying failed jobs
    - This will include Users and Roles management and login
- Improve api routes versioning (if needed)
- Full test case coverage
- Add logs monitoring in Admin panel
